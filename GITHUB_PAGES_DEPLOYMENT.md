# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Overview
DreamGarden has been optimized for static hosting on GitHub Pages. The AI features have been removed to ensure compatibility with static hosting while maintaining all other functionality.

## ✅ What's Included
- ✅ Garden management
- ✅ Task management
- ✅ Weather monitoring (with default API key)
- ✅ Analytics dashboard
- ✅ Settings page
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Local data persistence

## ❌ What's Removed
- ❌ AI Assistant (requires server-side functionality)
- ❌ OpenAI API integration
- ❌ Server-side features

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository Setup
1. Fork or clone this repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings
3. Set the source to "GitHub Actions"

### 2. Environment Variables
Add the following secrets in your repository settings (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions):

```
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here
```

**Note**: If no weather API key is provided, the app will use demo weather data.

### 3. Deploy
1. Push your changes to the `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy to GitHub Pages
3. Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`

## 🌐 Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update your DNS settings accordingly

## 🔄 Manual Deployment
If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# The built files will be in the `out` directory
# Upload these files to your web server
```

## 📝 Configuration
The app is configured for static hosting with:
- `output: 'export'` in next.config.js
- Unoptimized images for static hosting
- Client-side data persistence using localStorage
- No server-side dependencies

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check that Node.js version is 18 or higher
- Verify environment variables are set correctly

### Weather Not Working
- Check that your weather API key is valid
- The app will fall back to demo data if no API key is provided
- Weather data is fetched client-side for static hosting compatibility

### Data Persistence
- All data is stored in browser localStorage
- Data persists between sessions but is device-specific
- No server-side database required

## 🔒 Security Notes
- No sensitive data is stored on servers
- All data processing happens client-side
- Weather API calls are made directly from the browser
- No authentication required (local storage only)

## 📊 Performance
- Optimized for static hosting
- Minimal bundle size
- Fast loading times
- Works offline (except weather data)

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Deploy to GitHub Pages
2. Test all features
3. Share your garden management app!
4. Consider adding more features that work with static hosting

Your DreamGarden app is now ready for GitHub Pages deployment! 🌱✨
